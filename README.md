# GettingAndCleaningData

This project consists of two files:

1. run_analysis.R
2. WriteData.R


To run the first script, run_analysis.R, the working directory needs to be set to the /UCI HAR Dataset directory in the Samsung dataset. 
+The first script will take the following steps:
+1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
+2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
+3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
+4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
+5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
+
+To start with, the script loads the package 'dplyr' 
+Then the working directory is set. This is a specific working directory for my system, it should be edited if the script is to be run on a different system.
+
+The files containing the activity labels and the features are loaded individually into dataframes.
+The data from the train and test direcories is loaded in two dataframes, trainingdata and testdata.
+
+The data from x_train.txt and x_test.txt is combined in one dataframe, Dataset, by using rbind()
+This is repeated for  y_train.txt and y_test.txt (into Activity) and subject_train.txt and subtject_test.txt (into Subject).
+
+Since only nean and standard deviation data is required, those features with 'Mean' or 'std' in the name are filtered from the features and loaded into a new dataframe.
+The first column from the dataframe is used to select the relevant columns from the dataframe containing the measurements.
+
+In order to represent the activity names in the final dataset the dataset Activity is merged with the dataset activity_label. This produces a dataframe containing the activity_labels on the rows corresponding to the individual measurement.
+The column containing the activity labels per measurement is added to the Dataset dataframe by cbind() and the name of the column is set .
+
+In order to correctly label the measurements the feature descriptions are added to the Dataset with the name for the Activity column hardcoded.
+
+Then a second dataset is created, the subjects are added. 
+
+By aggregating the dataset by Subject and Activity and applying the function mean the average values are calculated per group of subject and activityty.

The result of the first script is a dataframe Dataset2

When the second script, WriteData.R, is run it will export this to a file OutputCourseProject.txt in the working directory.
