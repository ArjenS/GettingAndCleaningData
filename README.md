# GettingAndCleaningData

This project consists of two files:

1) run_analysis.R
2) WriteData.R

To run the first script the working directory needs to be set to the /UCI HAR Dataset directory in the Samsung dataset. 
Running this script will result in a dataframe Dataset2. The second script will write this data to a file OutputCourseProject.txt to the working directory.
